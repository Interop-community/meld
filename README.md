## About Meld

MELD was created with hope that it could help be a tool the healthcare ecosystem could use to help improve healthcare applications and emerging healthcare standards. It hoped to achieve this through not only being an open-source platform, but also one that is driven by working together as a community.

#### Ease of Use

MELD was designed in a way that it is easy to access and use. Creating an account in the MELD sandbox is as simple as putting in your information and verifying your email. Once an account is created, users can immediately start spinning up sandboxes. 
Once inside the sandbox, all the different features are clearly laid out and easy to access. The navigation bar on the left side of the screen will take users to each page of the sandbox. 

#### FHIR Resources

MELD hosts fully synthetic yet realistic FHIR resources. The data types currently available in the MELD sandbox are FHIR DSTU2, FHIR STU3, and FHIR R4. The capability to host FHIR R5 data is built into the sandbox, but getting synthetic FHIR R5 data is still a work in process.
